    "### Factors that Affect CPU Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clock Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate at which instructions are processed by the CPU is controller by the clock speed. The faster the clock speed, the faster the rate of processing.\n",
    "However, increasing the clock speed has disadvantages:\n",
    "- The instructions are processed by transistors and the rate at which they operate is limited.\n",
    "- The processor generates a large amount of heat and this increases as the clock speed increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NUmber of Processors Cores\n",
    "\n",
    "Manufacturers introduces **multicore processors** in 2006 to increase processing speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Img/U4_17_dual_core.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of multicore processors are that the cores can work:\n",
    "- together on the same program - this is called parallel processing\n",
    "- on different prograns at the same time - this is called multitasking\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all prograns will run faster in a multicore. As the tasks required cannot be carried out in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Size of Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "- L1 cache. It’s right up close by the core for quick, easy access, and it’s usually split into separate sections for data and instructions\n",
    "- L2 cache may be shared between cores or dedicated to each core. Unlike L1 cache, however, it usually mixes data and instructions rather than separating them out.\n",
    "- L3 cache – is most typically shared between cores. That means that data fetched for one core is also available to the other cores so they don’t have to do separate fetches\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Img/U4_17_cache_2.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With a larger chache there is a greater probability that the instruction or data item to be fetched is in the cahce and so the RAM will not need to be accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "The more permanent storage is called **secondary storage**. Secondary storage is non volative an, compared to RAM, is slower to access, cheaper and has much higher storage capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secondary storage** any kind of permanent storage to which the contents of ROM/RAM are copied.\n",
    "- **Magnetic storage** secondary storage that works by making parts of a substance behave like a magnet.\n",
    "- **Optical storage** secondary storage that works using differences in light reflection from a material.\n",
    "- **Solid-State Storage (SSD)** secondary storage that works by storing charge (electrons)\n",
    "- **Platers** rigid, rapidly rotating, magnetically coated disks within a hard disk drive.\n",
    "- **latency** refers to any kind od delay that data travelling through a network might encounter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Magnetic Secondary Storage - Hard Disks\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Img/U4_17_HDD.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- The arm moves across to be above the right track\n",
    "- the required sector comes around under the head\n",
    "- the surface behaving like a magnet caused a tiny current in the head\n",
    "- the disk controller translates this into 1s and 0s\n",

    "#### Optical Secondary Storage - DVDS\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Img/U4_17_DVD.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The disk spins in the drive to ensure all data can be read.\n",
    "2. The tracking mechanism moves the laser into the correct position over the disk.\n",
    "3. The laser shines on to the disk and is reflected back on to a light sensor.\n",
    "4. Signals from the sensor are translated into 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Electrical Secondary Storage - Flash Drives\n",
    "\n",
    "Solid-state storage uses chips (called NAND flash) made of special kinds of transistors that can trap electrons in a 'pool'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Img/U4_17_SSD.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Control signals identify which bit is to be read out and apply a small voltage.\n",
    "2. If the electron pool is empty the transistor turns on and a 1 is read out.\n",
    "3. if the electron is full the transistor doesn't turn on and a 0 is read out.\n",
    "4. The control signals changed to read other bits\n",
    "5. When data is written to the chip, control signals identify which bit is to be written and apply a higher voltage.\n",
    "6. This pulls electrons into the pools of those transistors, recording the 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both erasing and writing cause the transistor to break down slowly. This means that flash drives can only be rewritten around 1 million times before eventually failing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to have a back-up copy of your data in a secure location or share your data with users of other computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Could Storage** secondary storage, often belonging to a third party, that is accessed via network, usualy the Internet, and so is not in the same physical place as the machine;s RAM/ROM. Files stored 'in the could' can be accessed from anywhere via an internet connection.\n",
    "- **Virtualisation** any process that hides the true physical nature of a computing resource, making it look different, usually to simplify the way it is accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google drive is an example of **virtualisation**. You seem to have access to a single virtual hard drive when your storage might be spread across several servers around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing data on servers accessed via the Internet has the following advantages:\n",
    "- You can access the data from anywhere on many devices.\n",
    "- The data is securely backef up by the company providing the storage service.\n",
    "- You don't need to transfer your data if you get a new computer.\n",

    "- **Operating system**: software designed for a particular hardware and which manages other programs' access to the hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **OS** provides a set of commamds such as ```OpenFile``` or ```DisplayJPEG```. The set of commands is usually called an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **OS** also shares access to the hardware among the different programs that are running:\n",
    "- When you have several application open, they can't really run at the same time (von Neumann system). The **OS** keeps this illusion by allowing each program to use the CPU for a short time. This is called **scheduling**.\n",
    "- What happens if the **RAM** is full? remember the **virtual memory**? This is called **paging** or swapping.\n",

Authority to use the computer system is based on what *right* you have. Simple user might not be able to install new program but the super-user (sometimes called administrator or root) can access all ressources and also control the access rights of other users.\n",

    "- **Heuristic**: A heuristic model is a problem-solving technique that uses simple methods to quickly find a solution. Heuristics are also known as mental shortcuts or rules of thumb. They are often used when there isn't enough information to come up with a definitive answer\n",
    "- **Monte Carlo method**: A Monte Carlo model is a computational algorithm that uses random sampling to model and analyze complex systems or processes. The larger the number of samples used, the more accurate the resilt is likely.\n",
