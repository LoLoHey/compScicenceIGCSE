    "\n",
    "Everythin we do has an impact on the environment and manufacture, use and disposal computing devices is no exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more **computing technology** we buy, the more we throw away. We are using up resources of non-renewable materials, creating potentially harmful **e-waste**, consuming energy and damaging people's health.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **computing technology** and all-encompassing term referring to the hardware, software and infrastructure that underpin current and emerging computer systems.\n",

    "In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to improce tthe energy efficiency of computing device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data centers are major energy users. Vast amounts of electricity are needed to power and cool all the computer equipment that is needed. Energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy can significantly reduce the **carbon footprint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **carbon footprint** the amount of carbon dioxide an individual or organisation produces as a result of the energy they consume\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary problem with disposing of e-waste is that electronic devices often contain hazardous chemicals like lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants, which can severely contaminate the environment and harm human health if not disposed of properly, potentially polluting soil, water, and air when dumped in landfills or improperly recycled.\n",
